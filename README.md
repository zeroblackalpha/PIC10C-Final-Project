# PIC10C-Final-Project

This project is meant to demonstrate the process by which K-means clustering quantizes an image.
The goal is to provide a GUI that can both take in and spit out PNG files for ease of use.
The choice of PNG is a necessary one as an uncompressed image is required.

## Completed Features
* Rudimentary K-means backend
* K-means++ initializations
* Preliminary GUI
* Step by step algorithm visualization
* File Open/Save
* PNG File Support

## Future Improvements
* Classification optimization (K-D Tree)
* Multi-threading
* Improve memory use
* Improved explanation
* Correct iteration counter
* Correct iteration progress bar
* Prevent GUI lockup
* Support for other image formats
