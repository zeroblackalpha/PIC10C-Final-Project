# PIC10C-Final-Project

This project is meant to demonstrate the process by which K-means clustering quantizes an image.
The goal is to provide a GUI that can both take in and spit out PNG files for ease of use.
The choice of PNG is a necessary one as an uncompressed image is required.

## Incomplete features
1. Classification optimizations
2. GUI
3. Multi-threading
